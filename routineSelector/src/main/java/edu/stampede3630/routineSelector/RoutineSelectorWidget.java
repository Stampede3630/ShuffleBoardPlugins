/**
 * If you haven't looked at App.Java yet.... Do so.....
 * Congrats! You created a plugin that houses all the cool widgets you are about to make.  This file
 * contains one of those widgets.  First things first, this specific java class extends SIMPLEannotatedWidget,
 * which means that this widget only deals with one data property.  This specific widget only returns the
 * selected deliver location.  That location is, of course, a string.  So in the attributes portion of this 
 * method we return StringType.  You can see all the other different datatypes by right clicking on dataTypes
 * and looking at all the other definitions.
 *
 * This java class only sets up the behavior of the widget.  For THIS specific widget, we care about when the
 * user selects a button, and when the user resizes the widget.
 * 
 * All the specifics of the graphics and the placement of the widget are placed in another attribute called
 * "Parametrized Controller" The value passed into this attribute is the name of the FXML file.  This file
 * just needs to have the same package declared at the top of page.
