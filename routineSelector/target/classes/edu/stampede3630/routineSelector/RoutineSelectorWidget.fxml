<!--  
    You made it!!!  If you are totally confused... you should navigate to:
    ShuffleBoardPlugins/routineSelector/src/main/java/edu/stampede3630/routineSelector/
    
    Alrite firstoff, we're in a completely different folder structure, why, I don't know I followed a tutorial.
    I'm not entirely sure why Java knows that folder exists. I THINK it's because we declared the connection
    below in the fx:controller.
    
    Now we look a little different.  This is like XML and Java had a baby.  You can see that imports
    look ver similiar to java imports.  The rest.... not so much.  You can technically add scripting code in
    here... but haven't found the need for it yet.

    First things first, shuffleboard widgets are basically panes that contain (children or nodes). So we open
    (I don't know XML terminology) by defining an AnchorPane.  "xmlns:fx" just says we will use the prefix "fx"
    everytime we want to use JavaFX terminology.  We then define what controls are pane which is a reference to 
    our java classes here: 
    ShuffleBoardPlugins/routineSelector/src/main/java/edu/stampede3630/routineSelector/RoutineSelectorWidget.java
    
    fx:id for this line needs to match what you declared in the widget class
    stylesheets allow us to point to a CSS file where I can edit fonts, change backgrounds etc.

<AnchorPane xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" fx:controller="edu.stampede3630.routineSelector.RoutineSelectorWidget" 
fx:id="_thePane" stylesheets="@cssfilepath.css" minWidth="100" minHeight="100">
    <!-- I defined a whole bunch of variables in the define block below.  The first one is the Togglegroup.
         The radiobuttons need to attach to SOMETHING.  So if I declare an fx:id then I can reference it later
         
         The rest are doubles.  In order to ensure things lined up properly I declared a whole bunch of doubles.
         That way one coordinate change changes the alignment on a whole bunch of buttons so things stay inline.

    <!-- Here's all the elements that I care about below.  They are appropriately under the children tag.  This allows
         me to cycle through all children and change translateX and translateY to different positions -->
    <children>
        <TextField  fx:id="_selected" layoutX="50" layoutY ="87.6"/>
        
        <RadioButton fx:id="leftHigh" layoutX="0" layoutY="0"/>
        <RadioButton fx:id="rightHigh" layoutX="0" layoutY="0"/>
        <RadioButton fx:id="midHigh" layoutX="0" layoutY="0"/>
        <RadioButton fx:id="leftMid" layoutX="0" layoutY="0"/>
